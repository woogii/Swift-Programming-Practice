# Colour Memory 
The application posts user-generated location information to a shared map, pulling the locations of fellow Nanodegree students, with custom messages about themselves or their learning experience.

# Features

* Once users log in successfully, they can see a map with pins specifying the last 100 locations posted by students.
* If the user taps a pin, an annotation will pop up and shows a brief description including a student's name and a URL link. 
* When the list tap is selected, the most recent 100 locations posted by students are displayed in a table.

* When users click a bar button shaped like a pin in the top of the view, the app present a new screen.
* Users can type the location where they are studying now, which will be followed by a forward geocoding process after users click the 'Find on the Map' button.
* If the forward geocode succeeds, then the app changes the screen and displays a map showing the entered location. 
* At the final step, users can enter a link of whatever they want to post.
